# Best practices
 - Start with Claude-generated agents: We highly recommend generating your initial subagent with Claude and then iterating on it to make it personally yours. This approach gives you the best results - a solid foundation that you can customize to your specific needs.
 - Design focused subagents: Create subagents with single, clear responsibilities rather than trying to make one subagent do everything. This improves performance and makes subagents more predictable.
 - Write detailed prompts: Include specific instructions, examples, and constraints in your system prompts. The more guidance you provide, the better the subagent will perform.
 - Limit tool access: Only grant tools that are necessary for the subagentâ€™s purpose. This improves security and helps the subagent focus on relevant actions.



# Advanced usage
 - Chaining subagents
    - For complex workflows, you can chain multiple subagents:
    > First use the code-analyzer subagent to find performance issues, then use the optimizer subagent to fix them
